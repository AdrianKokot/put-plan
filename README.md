# PUT Plan

## About

### Purpose

The purpose of this project is to make cleaner and easier way to check current classes at the University. App was made with Poznan University of Technology's way of planning student's classes in mind, so the app isn't universal at all. Maybe some day will be.

Made especially for IT department, 2020-2024 class, group I3.

App is hosted on [put-plan.web.app](https://put-plan.web.app) via firebase.

### Tech stack

- Angular 
- TailwindCSS
- hammerjs
- firebase

### My goal

Besides the purpose, at first, I created this project to train my angular skills. After some time, I decided to try GitHub actions and GitHub apps.

Probably many things could be done better, but there are the results:
