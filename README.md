# PUT Plan

## Project purpose

The purpose of this project is to make cleaner and easier way to check current classes at the University. App was made with Poznan Univeristy of Technology's way of planning student's classes in mind, so the app isn't universal at all. Maybe some day will be.

Made especially for IT deparment, 2020-2024 class, group I3.

App is hosted on [put-plan.web.app](https://put-plan.web.app) via firebase.

## Tech stack
 - Angular 11.2.1
 - TailwindCSS 2.0.3
 - Firebase hosting
 - Firestore (not in use at the moment)

## Pull requests

Feel free to make pull requests, but don't overdo it, it's simple app.

## Planned functionality

 - [ ] PWA
 - [ ] Possibility to select your English classes period
 - [ ] Move 'database' (json files in assets folder) to actual database
 - [ ] Remove/redo light theme - it's ugly
 - [ ] Add data for the whole department
